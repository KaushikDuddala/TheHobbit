Thorin is brave, but also "very haughty," and his leadership of the dwarves is unchallenged (Tolkien, 11). Thorin, like many of his kind, has a desire for gold. As the grandson of Thror, he believes the treasure under The Lonely Mountain is his birthright which was stolen by the dragon. "'But we have never forgotten our stolen treasure. And even now, when I will allow we have a good bit laid by and are not so badly off'-here Thorin stroked the gold chain round his neck-'we still mean to get it back, and to bring our curses home to Smaug if we can.'" <br><br>Background<br><br>Thorin is the grandson of Thror who was known as the King Under the Mountain, as it is stated "Thorin, an enormously important dwarf, [is] in fact no other than the great Thorin Oakenshield himself&nbsp;" (Tolkien 11). His birthright was stolen by Smaug and he had Bilbo help go on a quest to retrieve it. Thorin is also the leader of the a group of 13 dwarves, including himself. These dwarves along with Bilbo are the original Adventuring Co.&nbsp;</p>

Thorin was one of the only dwarves to survive the evil dragon Smaug capturing the Lonley Mountain and burning the town of Dale next to it. Thorin recounts "I was one luckily -a fine adventurous lad in those days, always wandering about, and it saved my life that day" (Tolkien 23).<br>&nbsp;2. Thorin is overcome with greed, but changes in the end after apologizing to Bilbo. "But none of our gold shall thieves take or the violent carry off while we are alive. " (Tolkien 236).<br>3. Thorin fights off many goblins during the Battle of Five Armies. "Wolf and rider fell or fled before them. Thorin wielded his axe with mighty strokes, and nothing seemed to harm him. 'To me! To me! Elves and Men! To me! O my kinsfolk!' he cried, and his voice shook like a horn in the valley" (Tolkien 269).</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 50px;color: rgb(0,0,0);margin-top: -16px;">Enneagram Type (Personality)</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;padding-top: 0px;margin-top: -3px;">An enneagram is a figure used to determine someone's personality. There are 9 different "types" that a person can have, Thorin is a type 8 enneagram, which is known as the "Challenger". This explains Thorin's bravery, confidence and his greed for gold. Thorin is the descendant of the King Under the Mountain who lost his throne when Smaug came and ousted the dwarves from their home. He has great bravery and integrity, but his love for the treasure that was stolen from him and his people leads him behave stubbornly and selfishly even after he has won it back. "Bilbo thought that Thorin would at once admit what justice was in them. He did not, of course, expect that any one would remember that it was he who discovered all by himself the dragon's weak spot; and that was just as well, for no one ever did. But also he did not reckon with the power that gold has upon which a dragon has long brooded, nor with dwarvish hearts. Long hours in the past days Thorin had spent in the treasury, and the lust of it was heavy on him" (Tolkein 241). This quote references how Thorin was unaware of the power of gold and dwarves' hearts, but he had spent long hours in the treasury, feeling the lust of it which also confirms his greed.<br>Enneagram type 8's are a member of the Gut Triad. The Gut Triad is more focused on their gut feeling than what their heart tells them or what their mind says. They rely mainly on their gut feeling to make decisions which Thorin is known for.</p>
