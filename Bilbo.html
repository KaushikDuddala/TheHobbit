Because of this, Bilbo always has a subtle longing to go on fantastic expeditions, and after his first one, he founded the adventuring company along with Thorin. Bilbo is a fantastic adventurer and is motivated by his Tookish nature and love for riches. The end goal always drives him to finish the challenges at hand. When dwarves first sang about the treasures of the Lonely Mountain, "something Tookish woke up inside him, and he wished to go and see the great mountains, and hear the pine-trees and the waterfalls, and explore the caves, and wear a sword instead of a walking stick...He thought of the jewels of the dwarves shining in dark caverns" (Tolkien 16). He is sneaky and crafty, able to stay out of sight and regroup with a solution to any problem he might face. His solutions keep the safety of the party intact and always allows the adventure to continue. When Bilbo lost the members of his adventuring party, he formed a plan "now [that] he had [a] magic ring, to go back into the horrible, horrible, tunnels and look for his friends. He had just made up his mind that it was his duty, that he must turn back" (Tolkien 85).</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 217, 102); background-color: transparent;">Background</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 217, 102); background-color: transparent;">Most Hobbits are "plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures," but occasionally members of the Took Clan would sneak off to explore. (Tolkien 6). Bilbo used to dislike adventure, but when he reluctantly agreed to his first adventure with Thorin and the other dwarves, Bilbo embraced his Tookish nature and realized he was born to adventure. After successfully returning, "It is true that for ever after he remained an elf-friend, and had the honour of dwarves, wizards, and all such folk as ever passed that way; but he was no longer quite respectable. He was in fact held by all the hobbits of the neighbourhood to be 'queer'...[but still] he was quite content" (Tolkien 275).</span></p>

He dared go no further. He had lost: lost his prey, and lost, too, the only thing he had ever cared for, his precious (Tolkien 82).<br><br>2. Fighting and distracting a horde of giant spiders in the depths of Mirkwood. "They could not see Bilbo, but they could make a good guess at the direction from which the stones were coming. As quick as lightning they came running and swinging towards the hobbit, flinging out their long threads in all directions, till the air seemed full of waving snares. Bilbo, however, soon slipped away to a different place." (Tolkien 146).<br><br>3 . Navigating the halls of the Wood Elves to rescue his fellow adventurers. "they caught the main stream and went sailing away down, down towards the Lake. They had escaped the dungeons of the king and were through the wood," (Tolkien 173).&nbsp;</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;padding-top: 0px;margin-top: -3px;margin-left: 35px;margin-right: 35px;">An enneagram is a figure used to determine someone's personality. There are 9 different "types" that a person can have, Bilbo is a type 6 Enneagram, also known as the Loyalist. This reflects that he is energetic, honest, and dependable. Bilbo is also very analytical, retaining all the information he hears to come up with great solutions. After his party almost gave up getting into the Lonely Mountain, "suddenly when their hope was lowest a red ray of the sun escaped like a finger through a rent in the cloud. A gleam of light came straight through the opening into the bay and fell on the smooth rock-face...A flake of rock split from the wall and fell. A hole appeared suddenly about three feet from the ground. Quickly, trembling lest the chance should fade, the dwarves rushed to the rock and pushed-in vain," But Bilbo remembered an important detail from the beginning of the adventure, "'The key! The key!' cried Bilbo. 'Where is Thorin?'" (Tolkien 194). The key Bilbo was referencing was the key needed to open the hole in the mountain, and if it wasn't due to Bilbo's quick thinking, the adventure would have failed.<br>Enneagram type 6's are a member of the Head Triad (a traid is a classification of enneagrams). The Head Triad are more focused on thinking with their minds instead of their hearts or gut feelings, which Bilbo usually does.&nbsp;</p>
