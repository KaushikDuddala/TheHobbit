                <p style="font-size: 38px;margin-top: 45px;color: rgb(191,210,76);">While Bilbo and Thorin both are adventurers that work well together, they have their similarities and differences:</p>

            <div class="col-xl-8">
                <p style="margin-right: 94px;color: rgb(211,222,78);margin-bottom: 66px;margin-top: 148px;margin-left: 41px;">Both are motivated by treasure and riches. When the dwarves first sang about the Lonely Mountain, Bilbo was filled with "the desire of the hearts of dwarves", which is the desire to be rich. This is reflected by Thorin when they are inside the Lonely Mountain, as "long hours in the past days Thorin had spent in the treasury, and the lust of it was heavy on him. Though he had hunted chiefly for the Arkenstone, yet he had an eye for many another wonderful thing that was lying there" (Tolkien 241). Also, both Bilbo and Thorin can fight well. In Mirkwood Forest, Bilbo was able to fight off gaitn spiders with ease. "Bilbo came at [the spider] before it could disappear and struck it with his sword right in the eyes. Then it went mad and leaped and danced and flung out its legs in horrible jerks, until he killed it with another stroke" (Tokien 143-144). During the Battle of Five Armies, Thorin was able to skillfully defeat his foes and command the dwarves, elves, and lake-men. "Wolf and rider fell or fled before them. Thorin wielded his axe with mighty strokes, and nothing seemed to harm him. 'To me! To me! Elves and Men! To me! O my kinsfolk!' he cried, and his voice shook like a horn in the valley" (Tolkien 269).<br><br>Both Bilbo and Thorin are different in the fact that Bilbo acts for the common good of everyone that is involved, while Thorin acts for himself. Bilbo steals the fabled Arkenstone from the dwarves in order to force peace between the dwarves and elves/lake-men. ""This is the Arkenstone of Thrain," said Bilbo, "the Heart of the Mountain; and it is also the heart of Thorin. He values it above a river of gold. I give it to you. It will aid you in your bargaining."&nbsp;(Tolkien 248). When Thorin finds out about this, he gets very upset because he cares about the Arkenstone more than anything else. After Bilbo tells him that he gave away the Arkenstone, Thorin flies into a rage. "You! You!" cried Thorin, turning upon him and grasping him with both hands. "You miserable hobbit! You undersized-burglar!" he shouted at a loss for words, and he shook poor Bilbo like a rabbit. (Tolkien 251).<br><br>Despite their differences, both Bilbo and Thorin come to respect each other. In a farewell, Thorin tells Bilbo: "There is more in you of good than you know, child of the kindly West. Some courage and some wisdom, blended in measure. If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world (Tolkien 263).<br>Background<br><br>Most Hobbits are "plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures," but occasionally members of the Took Clan would sneak off to explore. (Tolkien 6). Bilbo used to dislike adventure, but when he reluctantly agreed to his first adventure with Thorin and the other dwarves, Bilbo embraced his Tookish nature and realized he was born to adventure. After successfully returning, "It is true that for ever after he remained an elf-friend, and had the honour of dwarves, wizards, and all such folk as ever passed that way; but he was no longer quite respectable. He was in fact held by all the hobbits of the neighbourhood to be 'queer'...[but still] he was quite content" (Tolkien 275).</p>
